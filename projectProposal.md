## ABSTRACT

*Locating a viable parking spot on the CSUSM campus typically requires a significant and rather frustrating amount of time. The time it takes usually varies from semester to semester and is dependent on the quantity of students on campus at any given minute. In order to figure out an optimal time to arrive on campus before class a student may have to endure weeks of trial and error; most of the time resulting in no concrete answer. Wasted time by arriving to campus early or late could possibly be minimized resulting in a better commute time for students and less tardy students in classes respectively.  We are proposing an application that will automate this process by allowing students to visually see the probability of finding a parking spot in any given parking lot at any given time. The application will also calculate the estimated time it will take for the student to walk from their parking lot to the front of their building. There are no CSUSM parking lot applications for the android or apple platforms.*

## INTRODUCTION

We are proposing a parking lot application for Android, which will utilize university class information to determine the optimal time a student should arrive on campus in order to find a park spot. The application will utilize…
1. Class Records – both time and attendance 
1. Users unique class schedule  
1. Distances from parking lots to specific buildings.
1. Number of parking spots on campus
in order to calculate the probability of a student finding a parking spot and also calculate an approximated time are arrival to the front of their building.

We are hoping to include features like
1. Clean interface with intuitive schedule entry system.
1. Map that delays the probability that a student will find a spot located in a particular row in the parking lot or level of the parking structure.
1. Dynamically change commute and walking times depending on real world events or events on campus. 
1. Set passwords to prevent unwanted access of class information
1. Customizable entries (off campus lunches) and expected recalculations
1. Multiple schedules for an individual user.

## Benefits
1. Utilization of customizable user schedules and password protection.
1. Internal class schedules that can be used for referencing.
1. Data storage and back ups
1. Ability to optimize commuting time to and from school.

## Beneficiaries
Any student or teacher at CSUSM that is required to commute to or park at school.
